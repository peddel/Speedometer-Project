# Speedometer Project

This project presents a Speedometer application developed using C++ and the Qt6 framework, providing a client interface displaying the speed, temperature and battery level, as well as a server interface providing the values. In addition, the project also has turn and warning signals with functional and audible sounds. The communication between server and client can be done using either TCP or UART. In case of a connection error, the interface displays a warning message.

This project demonstrates expertise in C++ programming, Qt6 for user interface development, and remote control system integration, emphasizing real-time monitoring and safety features.
